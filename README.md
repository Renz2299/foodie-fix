## Project Overview
Foodie Fix is a back end web application intended to help users find cooking inspiration and add their own recipes to a digital cookbook as well as allow other users to view their recipes. The application consits of three main pages: The Home page, which is the recipe directory showing all recipes added to the application from any users; the My Recipes page, which is individual to each user showing them the recipes they have added to the application themselves and; the Account page, where users can view and edit their account details.

## User Experience

### Project Goals
The primary goal of the application is to provide a helpful tool where users can browse existing recipes and leave reviews as well as add and edit their own recipes. Foodie Fix has two key target audience:
- People looking for cooking inspiration and new recipes to try.
- People wanting to store their recipes digitally for themselves and others to see.

These target audiences aren't exclusive and some users may want to use Foodie Fix for both purposes.

### Persona One

**User:** Sarah, 36

Sarah is a Data Analyst based in Surrey. Her and her husband have two young children, together they enjoy exploring the outdoors and taking their dog for walks in the woods.

**Sarah's Goals:**
- Find new recipes for family meals.
- Publish her own recipes so they are easy to access in the future.
- Get reviews on her own published recipes.

**How the site helps Sarah:**
- Allows her to find new recipes created by other users.
- Provides her with a digital cookbook where she can publish her own recipes.
- Allows other users to review her published recipes.

### Persona Two

**User:** Oscar, 52

Oscar is a Carpenter based in Newport, he enjoys spending time with his wife and family, albeit fleeting now that his three children are grown up.

**Oscar's Goals:**
- Publish his own recipes for his family and friends to try themselves.
- Find new recipes to try at his next family dinner party.

**How the site helps Oscar:**
- Allows him to publish his own recipes for others to find and try.
- Provides a directory of recipes for him to browse and try.

## Design Choices

### Colours

From looking at current cooking brands, orange and reds appears to be recurring colours due to their resemblance of food, specifically fruits. I wanted this site to be more vibrant, therefore I used Adobe Colour to test out brighter tones of orange and red until I came the colour scheme shown below.

![The final colour scheme (deep fuscia, white, deep orange, mustard & pale yellow)](foodie_fix/static/img/readme_imgs/colour_scheme_final.png)

This colour scheme was tested using Adobe's accessibility tools to check the contrast ratio of different colour combinations.
